<h3>About me</h3> 

I am an accomplished cybersecurity researcher with a solid decade of experience in the technical realm. My career has been centered around activities such as malware analysis, penetration testing, and  Threat Haunting. I have demonstrated advanced skills in developing cutting-edge solutions for the detection and mitigation of cyberattacks.

My passion for research has driven me to write articles on incident cases and my personal investigations. Through these writings, I introduce the philosophy of Cyber Security, delving into the hidden truths behind the development and creation of malware and probing the real intentions of cyber criminals.




Feel free to connect with me to discuss cybersecurity, ethical hacking, or any related topics. Let's work together to make the digital world more secure!
