:octocat: About Me 

I am an accomplished cybersecurity researcher with a solid decade of experience in the technical realm. My career has been centered around activities such as malware analysis, penetration testing, and red teaming. I have demonstrated advanced skills in developing cutting-edge solutions for the detection and mitigation of cyberattacks.

I have had the privilege of actively collaborating with University Hospital Enterprise of Modena, participating in forensic computing initiatives for the development of electronic health records and cyber security policies dedicated to clinical engineering. These experiences have underscored my ability to apply cybersecurity expertise in critical contexts, enhancing the security of healthcare infrastructures.

üìù **Passion for Research:** My passion for research has driven me to write articles on incident cases and my personal investigations. Through these writings, I introduce the philosophy of Cyber Security, delving into the hidden truths behind the development and creation of malware and probing the real intentions of cyber criminals.




Feel free to connect with me to discuss cybersecurity, ethical hacking, or any related topics. Let's work together to make the digital world more secure!
